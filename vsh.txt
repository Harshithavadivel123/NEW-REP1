A paragraph is a unit of writing composed of one or more sentences that centers on a single, coherent idea or topic, serving to organize written work by creating a distinct section that is easy for readers to follow. Good paragraphs typically begin with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by supporting sentences that develop and explain this idea, and may conclude with a summary sentence.
